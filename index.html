<p style="text-align:center"><b>Quotes that have nourished me!</b> <!-- Description of the page contents -->

<p style="text-align:justify">Here's to the crazy ones. &nbsp;The rebels. &nbsp;The misfits. &nbsp;The troublemakers. &nbsp;The round pegs in the square holes. &nbsp;The ones who see things differently. &nbsp;They are not fond of rules, &nbsp;and they have no respect for the status quo. &nbsp;You can quote them. &nbsp;Disagree with them. &nbsp;Glorify or vilify them. &nbsp;About the only thing you cant do is ignore them. &nbsp;Because they change things. &nbsp;They push the human race forward. &nbsp;For some may see them as the crazy ones, &nbsp;we see genius. &nbsp;Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, &nbsp;are the ones who do.

<p style="text-align:justify">The fight is won or lost far away from the witnesses- &nbsp;behind the lines, &nbsp;in the gym, &nbsp;and out there on the road. &nbsp;Long before I dance under those lights. <br>
