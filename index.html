<p style="text-align:center"><b>Quotes that have nourished me!</b> <!-- Description of the page contents -->

<p style="text-align:justify">Here's to the crazy ones. The rebels. The misfits. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things     differently. They are not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them. Disagree with them. Glorify or vilify them. About the onlything you cant do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. For some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
