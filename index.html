<p style="text-align:justify">Do you want to live forever, Harry?"

      "Yes, and so do you," said Harry. "I want to live one more day. Tomorrow I will still want to live one more day. 
      Therefore I want to live forever, proof by induction on the positive integers. If you don't want to die, it 
      means you want to live forever. If you don't want to live forever, it means you want to die.
      What would you do with eternity, Harry?"
      Harry took a deep breath. "Meet all the interesting people in the world, read all the good books and then write 
      something even better, celebrate my first grandchild's tenth birthday party on the Moon, celebrate my first 
      great-great-great grandchild's hundredth birthday party around the Rings of Saturn, learn the deepest and final 
      rules of Nature, understand the nature of consciousness, find out why anything exists in the first place, visit 
      other stars, discover aliens, create aliens, rendezvous with everyone for a party on the other side of the Milky Way 
      once we've explored the whole thing, meet up with everyone else who was born on Old Earth to watch the Sun finally go 
      out, and I used to worry about finding a way to escape this universe before it ran out of negentropy but I'm a lot more 
      hopeful now that I've discovered the so-called laws of physics are just optional guidelines."<br>
      ~ Eliezer Yudkowsky, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.

<p style="text-align:justify">Grant to us the serenity of mind to accept that which cannot be changed,&nbsp;courage to change that which can be 
      changed,&nbsp;and wisdom to know the one from the other. <br>
      ~ Karl Paul Reinhold Niebuhr

<p style="text-align:justify">Here's to the crazy ones. &nbsp;The rebels. &nbsp;The misfits. &nbsp;The troublemakers. &nbsp;The round pegs in the square holes. &nbsp;The ones who see things differently. &nbsp;They are not fond of rules, &nbsp;and they have no respect for the status quo. &nbsp;You can quote them. &nbsp;Disagree with them. &nbsp;Glorify or vilify them. &nbsp;About the only thing you cant do is ignore them. &nbsp;Because they change things. &nbsp;They push the human race forward. &nbsp;For some may see them as the crazy ones, &nbsp;we see genius. &nbsp;Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, &nbsp;are the ones who do.

<p style="text-align:justify">The fight is won or lost far away from the witnesses- &nbsp;behind the lines, &nbsp;in the gym, &nbsp;and out there on the road. &nbsp;Long before I dance under those lights. <br>
~ Muhammad Ali

<p style="text-align:justify">If one does not know to which port one is sailing, &nbsp;no wind is favorable. <br>
